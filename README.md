# Minecraft Chattanooga Public Library

Docker image for the Minecraft server at the Chattanooga Public Library

We use a [MinecraftEdu](https://minecraftedu.com/) at the library which uses a specific version of the Minecraft client that is not the latest version.

The goal of this image is to setup a fully functional and easy to manage Minecraft server *quickly*.

## Building

Ensure [docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed. Then, clone this repository. In the root of the project directory run: `docker build -t minecraft-chattlibrary .`

## Running

First, this image *requires* you to have a volume to store data. Create a data directory to store the Minecraft configuration and logs generated by the server.

Copy the following files in this repository to the data directory:
  * banned-ips.json
  * banned-players.json
  * eula.txt (You must agree to Mojang's EULA before the server will run)
  * ops.json
  * server.properties
  * whitelist.json

Within the data directory, you must also create a `logs` directory. You will also need to create a `world` directory which contains your Minecraft world. You can change this via the `server.properties` file if you wish.

Ensure you have a Minecraft world in your `world` directory, or Minecraft will generate one for you. You can use the [Chattanooga Minecraft world](https://github.com/ChattanoogaPublicLibrary/voxel-chattanooga) if you'd like.

After this is done, run the following command: `docker run -d -p 25565:25565 -i -v /wherever/your/minecraft/data/dir/is:/minecraft/data -t minecraft-chattlibrary /sbin/my_init`

Now you should have a fully functional Minecraft server.

## Logging In To The Container

Please see the instructions for the [Phusion baseimage](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker#login_ssh) to login to the container. You will have to modify the Dockerimage slightly to add your public keys.
